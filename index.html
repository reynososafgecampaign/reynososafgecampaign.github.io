        <div id="whyme_paragraph">My parents came to the United States thirty years ago in search of a better life. They
          came to this country with humble beginnings, like many immigrants. As a result of their economic struggle, I
          learned how important it is to work hard, but I also gained a better understanding of how important it is to
          have strong institutions and a functional government. Despite the fact that I realize we have a long way to go
          in achieving justice and equality for all, our country's values motivate me.
          <br><br>
          Local politics may seem less important than national politics at first glance. However, these local topics
          affect our daily lives and play an important role in shaping our communities. Real political change is built
          from the ground up, as history has repeatedly demonstrated. That's why I'm running for the AFGE President.

      <div id="env-box">
        <h4>Higher Pay</h4><br> As president of AFGE 1680, I will continue to fight and make sure we get higher pay for
        our officers. We are actively
        pushing for automatic GS-9 for our officers. Our goal is for our correctional officers to recieve the
        appropriate salary due to thier work. We believe that those who have sacrificed much, deserve to be rewarded
        handsomely. I have made it a goal to continue fighting for pay that reflects experience and dedication to this
        field. As your AFGE 1680 President I will fight for higher pay for our officers.


      </div>

      <div id="afh-box">
        <h4>Hazard Pay</h4><br>
        During 2020 and 2021 many of our officers had to put their life on the line, as we faced an external threat,
        covid-19. Many of our officers had to come to work and risk getting infected. In a similar vein, many others
        were contaminated yet remained resilient throughout. I will make sure that those heroes don't go unnoticed. I
        will continue to fight for a 25% hazard pay for those who worked during the covid-19 pandemic.
      </div>

      <div id="st-box">
        <h4>Retention</h4><br>Retention means keeping our best talent locally. I will continue to do this by fighting
        for a 10% retention, meaning all staff members will receive a 10% increase to their salary. Part of what makes
        our facility one of the best is diversity. However, not just any kind of diversity, diversity in terms of
        skillset. We each offer something new and interesting that help make our facility one of the nations best. I
        will continue to fight for appropriate compensation and competitive salaries.

          The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) is an American labor union representing over 670,000
          employees of the federal government, about 5,000 employees of the District of Columbia, and a few hundred
          private sector employees, mostly in and around federal facilities. AFGE is the largest union for civilian,
          non-postal federal employees and the largest union for District of Columbia employees who report directly to
          the mayor (i.e., outside D.C. public schools).<br><br>

          If you work in the Terminal Island area, like I do, you are most likely part of AFGE 1680 region. AFGE 1680
          has elections means to represent the constituents in the region. If you work at Termianl Island, I am running
          to represent you.<br><br>

        My goal is to build a strong relationship between workers at Terminal Island and AFGE to ensure that our
        members'
        voices are heard and represented. To make meaningful progress on important local issues, we
        need a culture in which any resident feels empowered to get involved in community action and local government to
        express their thoughts and opinions.<br><br>

        I am eager to serve my community and want to hear from you on how best I can be of service. Please contact
